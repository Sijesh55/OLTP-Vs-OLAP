OLTP Vs OLAP


OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)
Purpose: Designed for managing and processing high volumes of transactional data, such as daily operations of businesses (e.g., order entry, inventory management).
Characteristics:
Transactions: Supports numerous short online transaction queries (e.g., insert, update, delete).
Data Model: Typically uses normalized databases to minimize redundancy.
Query Type: Simple queries, often involving a few records.
Performance: Optimized for speed and efficiency of processing transactions with high concurrency.
Data Size: Generally deals with a smaller amount of data, but in a high transaction volume environment.


OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)
Purpose: Designed for complex queries and analysis of large volumes of data, often for decision-making and business intelligence (e.g., reporting, data mining).
Characteristics:
Queries: Supports complex queries and multi-dimensional analysis.
Data Model: Often uses denormalized databases (e.g., star schema, snowflake schema) to optimize read performance and aggregation.
Query Type: Complex queries that involve aggregations, historical data analysis, and multiple records.
Performance: Optimized for read-heavy operations, allowing for quick retrieval and analysis of data.
Data Size: Typically handles large datasets, often with historical data to provide insights over time.
